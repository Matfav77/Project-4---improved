# Project-4---improved

Project 4 in OpenClassrooms's Web Dev Path.

This project aimed at improving the SEO of an old, obsolete website. Black Hat techniques needed to be detected and deleted, while modern best practices needed to be implemented.

Full analysis and explanations were gathered in a report, sent alongside the website.
